This project was developed by João Tiago Aparício, student number 97155.

Options taken:

The fst's  "lemma2noun.fst", "lemma2adverb.fst", "lemma2verbip.fst", "lemma2verbis.fst" and "lemma2verbif.fst" were written in the respective txt files.
The "lemma2verb.fst" and "lemma2word.fst" were generated by union of the previewsly mentioned fst's.
The "word2lemma.fst" was generated by inverting the "lemma2word.fst". This option was taken due to the fact that they are the inverse of one another.


Comments on the solution developed

The solution developd works very well in many cases, but it fails (for many words on the portuguese language) frequently on the word2lemma fst. 
Every fst on the tests, that consists only in letters form a to z (an theis variations), is included 
is accepted in the word2lemma fst as verb on the third singular person of the indicative.
This happens due to the fact that no character is added to the infinitive (only the r is removed in this specific case).
I have included some tests to prove that impiricaly.
